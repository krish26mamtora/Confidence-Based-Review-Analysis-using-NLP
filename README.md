# Confidence-Based Review Analysis using NLP

This project explores the use of NLP models to understand how well user reviews on research papers align with their given confidence scores (rated 1 to 5).

---

## 📌 Objective

To investigate whether semantic similarity between research papers and user reviews (computed using NLP techniques) correlates with the users’ self-reported confidence scores.

## 🛠️ Models & Methods Used

We used the following techniques to compute similarity between a research paper and user review:

1. **BERT** - Pre-trained language model to capture deep contextual meaning.
2. **SciBERT** - A BERT variant trained on scientific texts for better domain-specific understanding.
3. **Jaccard Similarity** - A lexical-level comparison method based on set overlap.
